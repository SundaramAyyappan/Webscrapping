Webscrapping - swiggy data

Using Autoscraper with the help of Python , I have scraped data from Swiggy for a particular Location and by using the saved scraped model , got similar data from Swiggy (other locations).

With the help of Octoparse Webscrapping tool I have scrapped data from Naukri and Indeed website by customising the particular needed data. Created a pagination loop link which helps to scrape data from multiple pages
